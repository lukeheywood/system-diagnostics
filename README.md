# System Diagnostics
### Making sense of the mess

This repository contains patterns and playbooks for diagnosing when systems lose coherence over time:
drift, competing intents, hidden coupling, and quiet failure.

It exists to help **map complexity back to structure**.

## 🧭 Diagnostic Lens

Most system failures are not technical first.
They are structural:

- unclear intent,
- too many workflows,
- misaligned success criteria,
- or missing invariants.

This repo focuses on finding those upstream causes.

## 🗺️ System Mapping

A simple mapping frame used here:

1. Governing intent  
2. Main workflows  
3. Success criteria  
4. Drift risks

From this, structure emerges.

## ⚠️ What is Drift?

Drift happens when:
- new workflows introduce new goals,
- patches replace structure,
- and no one revisits the system’s purpose.

It’s slow. Quiet. And dangerous.
