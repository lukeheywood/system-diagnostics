🗺️ System Mapping Playbook

Reconstructing coherence from complexity

A lightweight method for understanding, questioning, and teaching systems by mapping intent, workflows, and drift.

🎯 Purpose

This playbook helps you:

make sense of messy system descriptions,

surface hidden assumptions,

detect drift and incoherence,

and position yourself as someone who thinks in systems, not tools.

It’s designed for:

interviews,

architecture conversations,

debugging discussions,

and early system design.

🧭 The Core Frame

When someone describes a system, always map:

Governing Intent — Why does this system exist?

Main Workflows — How does it try to achieve that?

Success Criteria — What does “good” look like?

Drift Risk — Where could coherence be eroding?

Everything else is downstream detail.

🧠 The Opening Question (your anchor)

Use this early in interviews or conversations:

“When I look at complex systems, I try to understand three things first:
the governing intent, the main workflows, and what success means.
Would you mind walking me through those for your platform?”

What this does:

frames the conversation upstream,

signals architecture thinking,

invites clarity before tools.

You immediately sound:

thoughtful,

structured,

not tool-obsessed.

🎧 How to Listen (Downstream → Upstream)

As they talk about:

APIs,

queues,

services,

agents,

tools,

integrations,

you silently translate into:

What intent does this serve?
Which workflow is this part of?
What outcome is it meant to produce?

You are clustering noise into candidate workflows under a candidate intent.
